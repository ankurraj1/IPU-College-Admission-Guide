  <h3>What is the difference between CSE and IT engg?</h3>
   <u>CSE:</u> Computer science engineers are involved in many aspects of computing, from the design of individual microprocessors, personal computers and supercomputers to circuit designing and writing software that powers them.

<u>IT:</u> Information Technology deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to store, protect process, transmit and securely retrieve data. IT professionals perform a variety of tasks that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases.
  <i> Frankly speaking in GGSIPU there is no major difference etween the two cources even the placement record is identical for both the streams. IT or CSE doesn't matter the thing which really matters is that do you have the <u>fire in  your belly</u> and are you in love with computers and coding or not.

   <U>EE</U> students may learn about electrical machines, power systems, controls and instrumentation, power electronics and power systems operation and control.
<u>EEE</u> students may learn basic electronics subjects like semiconductor devices, solid state physics, linear electronics, embedded systems, digital electronics, advanced electronics and maybe a subject related to integrated circuits as well. Studies on devices with voltages higher than fifty volts are part of the electrical engineering course. If the device under consideration has voltage requirements less than fifty volts, it is said to be a part of the course of electronics engineering. Power electronics is the study of how semiconductors can be used for high voltage engineering, and it aims to bridge the gap between the two streams.

	<h3> Course Details</h3>
	<p>Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field of science that includes a combination of mechanical engineering, electronics, computer engineering, telecommunications engineering, systems engineering and control engineering.[1][2] As technology advances, the subfields of engineering multiply and adapt. Mechatronics' aim is a design process that unifies these subfields. Originally, mechatronics just included the combination of mechanics and electronics, therefore the word is a combination of mechanics and electronics; however, as technical systems have become more and more complex the definition has been broadened to include more technical areas.</p>
	<h3>Job Profiles</h3>
	<p>A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system.  An industrial robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs. Engineering cybernetics deals with the question of control engineering of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture.</p>

	<h3> Course Details</h3>
	Power Engineering is actually a sub-field of engineering that relates to the following areas

Distribution, transmission & generation of electric power
The devices related to this field including transformers, electric generators and motors, AC and DC power and the conversion between them. Basically Power Engineering is a network of Inter-connected parts which convert different types of energy to electrical energy.
There are three basic subsystems of of Modern Power namely Transmission subsystem, Generation subsystem, Distribution system
These three systems produce the electricity, transmit it to load centers and transmit the power to the customers. Power generation means that the power is being transformed into electrical energy. Transmission system provides a means transporting electrical energy.
	    <h3>Job Profiles</h3>
		Power Engineers are employed in a variety of industries including Electric power generation, metallurgical industries, Gas processing industries, Chemical manufacturing industries and Paper manufacturing industries. All these industries may use Boilers in their plant process. Depending on the Plant design, the equipment may be indoors or outdoors depending on the type of industry. Workers may also be exposed to Extreme temperature working conditions for some period of time especially in Summer. Employees in this occupation may be required at times to perform a certain amount of Physical activity including moving heavy objects such as chemical drums, vertical ladders etc.

			Many people treat "mechatronics" as a modern buzzword synonymous with "electromechanical engineering".A Mechatronics engineer is usually involved in the production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives, planetary exploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, and CD
