<h1> ABOUT COLLEGES</h1>
<h2>1.USIT(Main Campus) </h2>
<p>Location:
University School of Information Technology (USIT) is located inside the newly constructed and recently shifted campus of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU) at Sector 16, Dwarka. It’s about one and a half kilometre from Dwarka Sector 14 Metro station on the Blue line and can be accessed in three ways; a 15 minute walk, a 7 rupee per person rickshaw ride or a free bus ride provided by the University itself. So in terms of accessibility it’s not bad once you manage to reach the Metro station.
Infrastructure:
The campus is a huge one with lots of open areas, refreshing gardens and sports facilities underway. The hostels are also in the pipeline and will be opened to the students by this academic year. 
However, there is a lack of proper parking space and the students are required to park their cars under the hot sun which turns their cars into furnaces during the summers. The library is common to all departments; it’s a two storey structure with enough space which, however, hasn’t been utilised appropriately and there are few places to sit and read books. 
Fees:
Rs. 48,000/- per year
Placements:
Again the students come up with a disgusted face and say “We had anticipated so much, and finally we land up with everyone else”. Average salaries come to around Rs. 4L a year, nothing great, most of the other engineering colleges manage to place students with nearly the same packages. TCS is the major recruiter there, and TCS is the major recruiter here! Microsoft, Google and Adobe do visit the campus but they just pick up a handful of lucky, (rather talented) chaps.

<h6>5.Mait</h6> 
<p>Location:
Located in the farthest Northwest of Delhi in an extremely remote area of Rithala (sector 22 of Rohini region), Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, usually referred as MAIT, is roughly 6-8 kilometres from Rithala metro station. Even though the college is located in a jungle (this is what all the students mutter), the metro feeders and Grameen seva (10 seater auto) charge you Rs. 10 till the college gate. Moreover, the services of these autos are pretty awesome. So, metros are the most sought after mode of commutation.

 

Infrastructure:
The college building is pretty impressive and has one of a kind infrastructure. The stereotype red brick building has a neat and clean campus and filled with hundreds of students due to the number of courses offered. The classrooms are not air conditioned but have comfortable benches. The library is well equipped with books available in abundance. The campus is wifi enabled and thus socializing isn’t a problem. The strategic feature of the campus is the way different buildings are connected. They have a unique staircase which is very innovative and quite appealing.

There is no hostel facility for girls within the campus. Fortunately, boys have one within the campus where there’re single and double seaters. The hostel charges are roughly around Rs. 17,000/- per year and the facilities are pretty average and nothing to boast about.

 

Fees:
Rs. 90,000 per year
